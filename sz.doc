     DESCRIPTION
	  Sz (send ZMODEM) uses	the ZMODEM, YMODEM or XMODEM error
	  correcting protocol to send one or more files	over a dial-in
	  serial port to a variety of programs running under PC-DOS,
	  CP/M,	Unix, VMS, and other operating systems.

	  This is a copyrighted	shareware program.  Commercial use of
	  this program is subject to licensing conditions detailed in
	  the rz.c source code.	 "Commercial Use" includes use of this
	  program to send files	to commercial and/or shareware
	  programs not published by Omen Technology INC.


	  This program is not designed to be called from cu(1) or
	  other	communications programs.  Unix flavors of Omen
	  Technology's Professional-YAM	communications software	are
	  available for	dial-out applications.


	  Sz sends one or more files with ZMODEM protocol.

	  ZMODEM greatly simplifies file transfers compared to XMODEM.
	  In addition to a friendly user interface, ZMODEM provides
	  Personal Computer and	other users an efficient, accurate,
	  and robust file transfer method.

	  ZMODEM provides complete END-TO-END data integrity between
	  application programs.	 ZMODEM's 32 bit CRC catches errors
	  that sneak into even the most	advanced networks.

	  Advanced file	management features include AutoDownload
	  (Automatic file Download initiated without user
	  intervention), Display of individual and total file lengths
	  and transmission time	estimates, Crash Recovery, selective
	  file transfers, and preservation of exact file date and
	  length.

	  The -y option	instructs the receiver to open the file	for
	  writing unconditionally.  The	-a option causes the receiver
	  to convert Unix newlines to PC-DOS carriage returns and

	  linefeeds.


	  Sb sends one or more files with YMODEM or ZMODEM protocol.
	  The initial ZMODEM initialization is not sent.  When
	  requested by the receiver, sb	supports YMODEM-g with
	  "cbreak" tty mode, XON/XOFF flow control, and	interrupt
	  character set	to CAN (^X).  YMODEM-g (Professional-YAM g
	  option) increases throughput over error free channels
	  (direct connection, X.PC, etc.) by disabling error recovery.

	  On Unix systems, additional information about	the file is
	  transmitted.	If the receiving program uses this
	  information, the transmitted file length controls the	exact
	  number of bytes written to the output	dataset, and the
	  modify time and file mode are	set accordingly.


	  Sx sends a single file with XMODEM or	XMODEM-1k protocol
	  (sometimes incorrectly called	"ymodem").  The	user must
	  supply the file name to both sending and receiving programs.

	  Iff sz is invoked with $SHELL	set and	iff that variable
	  contains the string rsh or rksh (restricted shell), sz
	  operates in restricted mode.	Restricted mode	restricts
	  pathnames to the current directory and PUBDIR	(usually
	  /usr/spool/uucppublic) and/or	subdirectories thereof.


	  The fourth form sends	a single COMMAND to a ZMODEM receiver
	  for execution.  Zcommand exits with the COMMAND return
	  value.  If COMMAND includes spaces or	characters special to
	  the shell, it	must be	quoted.


	  The fifth form sends a single	COMMAND	to a ZMODEM receiver
	  for execution.  Zcommandi exits as soon as the receiver has
	  correctly received the command, before it is executed.


	  The sixth form (sz -TT) attempts to output all 256 code
	  combinations to the terminal.	 In you	are having difficulty
	  sending files, this command lets you see which character
	  codes	are being eaten	by the operating system.



	  The meanings of the available	options	are:

	  +    Instruct	the receiver to	append transmitted data	to an
	       existing	file (ZMODEM only).
	  a    Instruct	the ZMODEM receiver to convert text file

     SZ(1)		Omen Technology	INC (OMEN)		 SZ(1)



	       format as appropriate for the receiving system.	Valid
	       only for	ZMODEM.
	  b    (ZMODEM)	Binary override: transfer file without any
	       translation.
	  c    Instruct	the receiver to	change the pathname if the
	       destination file	exists.
	  d    Change all instances of "." to "/" in the transmitted
	       pathname.  Thus,	C.omenB0000 (which is unacceptable to
	       MSDOS or	CP/M) is transmitted as	C/omenB0000.  If the
	       resultant filename has more than	8 characters in	the
	       stem, a "." is inserted to allow	a total	of eleven.
	  e    Escape all control characters; normally only XON, XOFF,
	       DLE, CR-@-CR, and Ctrl-X	are escaped.
	  f    Send Full pathname.  Normally directory prefixes	are
	       stripped	from the transmitted filename.
	  k    (XMODEM/YMODEM) Send files using	1024 byte blocks
	       rather than the default 128 byte	blocks.	 1024 byte
	       packets speed file transfers at high bit	rates.
	       (ZMODEM streams the data	for the	best possible
	       throughput.)
	  L N  Use ZMODEM sub-packets of length	N.  A larger N (32 <=
	       N <= 1024) gives	slightly higher	throughput, a smaller
	       N speeds	error recovery.	 The default is	128 below 300
	       baud, 256 above 300 baud, or 1024 above 2400 baud.
	  l N  Wait for	the receiver to	acknowledge correct data every
	       N (32 <=	N <= 1024) characters.	This may be used to
	       avoid network overrun when XOFF flow control is
	       lacking.
	  n    (ZMODEM)	Send each file if destination file does	not
	       exist.  Overwrite destination file if source file is
	       newer than the destination file.
	  N    (ZMODEM)	Send each file if destination file does	not
	       exist.  Overwrite destination file if source file is
	       newer or	longer than the	destination file.
	  o    (ZMODEM)	Disable	automatic selection of 32 bit CRC.
	  p    (ZMODEM)	Protect	existing destination files by skipping
	       transfer	if the destination file	exists.
	  r    (ZMODEM)	Resume interrupted file	transfer.  If the
	       source file is longer than the destination file,	the
	       transfer	commences at the offset	in the source file
	       that equals the length of the destination file.
	  rr   As above, but compares the files	(the portion common to
	       sender and reciever) before resuming the	transfer.
	  t tim
	       Change timeout to tim tenths of seconds.
	  u    Unlink the file after successful	transmission.
	  w N  Limit the transmit window size to N bytes (ZMODEM).
	  v    Verbose causes a	list of	file names to be appended to
	       /tmp/szlog .  More v's generate more output.
	  y    Instruct	a ZMODEM receiving program to overwrite	any
	       existing	file with the same name.
	  Y    Instruct	a ZMODEM receiving program to overwrite	any

     SZ(1)		Omen Technology	INC (OMEN)		 SZ(1)



	       existing	file with the same name, and to	skip any
	       source files that do have a file	with the same pathname
	       on the destination system.
	  Z    Use ZMODEM file compression to speed file transfer.

     DIAGNOSTICS
	  Exit status is as follows: 0 for successful transfers.  1 if
	  unrecoverable	errors are detected.  2	if syntax errors or
	  file access problems are detected.  3	if the program was
	  terminated by	a caught interrupt.

     EXAMPLES
	  ZMODEM File Transfer (Unix to	DSZ/ZCOMM/Professional-YAM)
	  % sz -a *.c
	  This single command transfers	all .c files in	the current
	  Unix directory with conversion (-a) to end of	line
	  conventions appropriate to the receiving environment.	 With
	  ZMODEM AutoDownload enabled, Professional-YAM	 and ZCOMM
	  will automatically recieve the files after performing	a
	  security check.

	  % sz -Yan *.c	*.h
	  Send only the	.c and .h files	that exist on both systems,
	  and are newer	on the sending system than the corresponding
	  version on the receiving system, converting Unix to DOS text
	  format.

	  ZMODEM Command Download (Unix	to Professional-YAM)
	   cpszall:all
	      zcommand "c:;cd /yam/dist"
	      sz -ya $(YD)/*.me
	      sz -yb y*.exe
	      zcommand "cd /yam"
	      zcommandi	"!insms"
	  This Makefile	fragment uses zcommand to issue	commands to
	  Professional-YAM to change current disk and directory.
	  Next,	sz transfers the .me files from	the $YD	directory,
	  commanding the receiver to overwrite the old files and to
	  convert from Unix end	of line	conventions to PC-DOS
	  conventions.	The third line transfers some .exe files.  The
	  fourth and fifth lines command Pro-YAM to change directory
	  and execute a	PC-DOS batch file insms	. Since	the batch file
	  takes	considerable time, the zcommandi form is used to allow
	  the program to exit immediately.

	  XMODEM File Transfer (Unix to	Crosstalk)
	  % sx foo.c
	  ESC
	  rx foo.c
	  The above three commands transfer a single file from Unix to
	  a PC and Crosstalk.  This combination	is much	slower and
	  less reliable	than ZMODEM.

     TESTING FEATURE
	  The command "sz -T file" exercises the Attn sequence error
	  recovery by commanding errors	with unterminated packets.
	  The receiving	program	should complain	five times about
	  binary data packets being too	long.  Each time sz is
	  interrupted, it should send a	ZDATA header followed by
	  another defective packet.  If	the receiver does not detect
	  five long data packets, the Attn sequence is not
	  interrupting the sender, and the Myattn string in sz.c must
	  be modified.

	  After	5 packets, sz stops the	"transfer" and prints the
	  total	number of characters "sent" (Tcount).  The difference
	  between Tcount and 5120 represents the number	of characters
	  stored in various buffers when the Attn sequence is
	  generated.

     NOTES
	  Sz is	not designed be	called from cu(1) or other outdial
	  communications programs.  Unix flavors of Omen Technology's
	  Professional-YAM communications software are available for
	  dial-out applications.

	  When using TrailBlazer or other buffered modems at high
	  speed, particular attention must be paid to flow control.
	  The modem and	Unix must agree	on the flow control method.
	  Sz on	USG (SYS III/V)	systems	uses XON/XOFF flow control.
	  If flow control cannot be properly set up, Try a "-w 2048"
	  option to enforce protocol level flow	control.  Experiment
	  with different window	sizes for best results.

	  Telebit modems must not be set to "spoof" UUCP, XMODEM, or

	  KERMIT.  Setting one of these	spoofing modes interferes with
	  other	protoocls.

	  If a program that does not properly implement	the specified
	  file transfer	protocol causes	sb to "hang" the port after a
	  failed transfer, either wait for sb to time out or keyboard
	  a dozen Ctrl-X characters.  Every reported instance of this
	  problem has been corrected by	using ZCOMM, Pro-YAM, DSZ, or
	  other	program	with a correct implementation of the specified
	  protocol.

	  Many programs	claiming to support YMODEM only	support	XMODEM
	  with 1k blocks, and they often don't get that	quite right.
	  XMODEM transfers add up to 127 garbage bytes per file.
	  XMODEM-1k and	YMODEM-1k transfers use	128 byte blocks	to
	  avoid	extra padding.

	  YMODEM programs use the file length transmitted at the
	  beginning of the transfer to prune the file to the correct
	  length; this may cause problems with source files that grow
	  during the course of the transfer.  This problem does	not
	  pertain to ZMODEM transfers, which preserve the exact	file
	  length unconditionally.

	  Most ZMODEM options are merely passed	to the receiving
	  program; some	programs do not	implement all of these
	  options.

	  Circular buffering and a ZMODEM sliding window should	be
	  used when input is from pipes	instead	of acknowledging
	  frames each 1024 bytes.  If no files can be opened, sz sends
	  a ZMODEM command to echo a suitable complaint; perhaps it
	  should check for the presence	of at least one	accessible
	  file before getting hot and bothered.

     BUGS
	  On at	least one BSD system, sz would abend it	got within a
	  few kilobytes	of the end of file.  Using the "-w 8192" flag
	  fixed	the problem.  The real cause is	unknown, perhaps a bug
	  in the kernel	TTY output routines.

	  The test mode	leaves a zero length file on the receiving
	  system.

Sep 1991: Major hacking to work around SVR4 bug.  Append and crash
recovery of shrinking files corrected.  Sz now supports rename.
Sz -c changed to zcommand, rx -c file changed to rc file.

Feb 1991: various corrections and simplifications.  Sz now
stores critical error messages for post mortem display.

The Man pages are formatted for those without Unix nroff.
For best results, use less(1) (available on comp.sources.misc)
as your manual page reader.

VMS systems are now supported with native VMS versions in
RZSZ.TLB.  The rz and sz in RZSZ.TLB support wild cards and
VMS record types.

May 1989: Corrections for undefined variable and multiply
defined rdchk() on some systems.

New for 1989: ZMODEM compression and other compatible
extensions have been added to the rz and sz programs.
Please read the comments in the rz.c and sz.c source code
for licensing information.

Previous versions of rz and sz (April 1988) remain Public Domain.

The contents of RZSZ.ZOO can be uploaded to a Unix or Xenix
system by ZCOMM or Professional-YAM using the supplied zupl.t
script.  Connect to your Unix/Xenix system, select an empty
directory, and then give the YAM/ZCOMM command: "source
zupl.t".  This will upload minirb.c, compile it, and then use
minirb to upload the rz/sz files.

Once these files are on your Unix system, you can type "make".
The Makefile will list the various systems it knows how to
compile the programs for, and the command to do so (e.g.,
"make bsd").

The Makefile is self explanatory; just say "make".

Naturally, rz and sz work best with comm programs that seamlessly
support ZMODEM command and file AutoDownload (Pro-YAM and ZCOMM).

The "GSZ" shareware program allows ZMODEM file transfers with
traditional DOS comm programs, but it must be called manually.
(The computer should do that for you!) GSZ provides a "mini
term function" that supports ZMODEM AutoDownload.  GSZ (part
of GSZ.ZIP) and ZCOMM (ZCOMMEXE.ZIP, ZCOMMDOC.ZIP,
ZCOMMHLP.ZIP) are available on TeleGodzilla and other fine
bulletin boards.

In order for us to process problem reports, we must have the
exact error messages displayed by Professional-YAM.

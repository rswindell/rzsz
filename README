May 1989: Corrections for undefined variable and multiply
defined rdchk() on some systems.

New for April 1989: ZMODEM compression and other compatible
extensions have been added to the rz and sz programs.  Please
read the comments in the rz.c and sz.c source code for
licensing information for commercial use.

Previous versions of rz and sz (April 1988) remain Public Domain.

New for April 1988: VMS C flavors of rz and sz especially for
tired frog stompers.  The following performance log entries
give the story!

 2400 Z  splat.arc         3968  220   18  0  0   0  512  30 (rz) 0 ccvax off

The contents of RZSZ.ARC can be uploaded to a VAX/XMS system
by ZCOMM or Professional-YAM using the supplied vupl.t script.
Connect to your VMS system, select an empty directory, and
then give the YAM/ZCOMM command: "source vupl.t".  This will
attempt to start a Kermit server ans upload the files to it.
If the script can't fire up a Kermit server, the script will
use the VMS DCL "create" command to upload the files directly.
In the latter case, use a clean line for best results.
Compile/Link directions for VMS C are in the comments at the
beginning of the rz.c and sz.c files.

The contents of RZSZ.ARC can be uploaded to a Unix or Xenix
system by ZCOMM or Professional-YAM using the supplied zupl.t
script.  Connect to your Unix/Xenix system, select an empty
directory, and then give the YAM/ZCOMM command: "source
zupl.t".  This will upload minirb.c, compile it, and then use
minirb to upload the rz/sz files.

Once these files are on your Unix system, you can type "make".
The Makefile will list the various systems it knows how to
compile the programs for, and the command to do so (e.g.,
"make bsd").

The Makefile is self explanatory; just say "make".

Naturally, rz and sz work best with comm programs that seamlessly
support ZMODEM command and file AutoDownload (Pro-YAM and ZCOMM).

The "DSZ" shareware program allows ZMODEM file transfers with
traditional DOS comm programs, but it must be called manually.
(The computer should do that for you!) DSZ provides a "mini
term function" that supports ZMODEM AutoDownload.  DSZ (part
of DSZ.ARC) and the ZMODEM protocol description (YZMODEM.ARC)
are on TeleGodzilla and other fine bulletin boards.
